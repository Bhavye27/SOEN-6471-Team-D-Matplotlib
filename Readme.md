## Details

Deliverable 1 focuses on providing a comprehensive understanding of matplotlib, which is our selected OPENARCH for this project. This deliverable consists of three distinct problems that need to be addressed. Problem 1 requires a concise description of matplotlib. This description encompasses the purpose of matplotlib, highlighting unique defining characteristics, and outlining the key software activities undertaken during its development. Problem 2 involves the creation of a context of use model for matplotlib which entails defining and describing each entity within the model. Lastly, Problem 3 entails constructing a stakeholder model for matplotlib, which can be represented through a UML Class Diagram or a mind map. The stakeholder model should identify and define each stakeholder involved in the matplotlib project.

These three problems collectively contribute to an in-depth understanding of matplotlibâ€™s purpose, usage context, and stakeholder involvement.
